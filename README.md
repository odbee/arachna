my research on algorithmic creation of spiderwebs. first experiments were two dimensional with manual attachment of edges. current experiment is 3D spiderwebs.

## Todo
* replacing random edge connection with more sophisticated algorithm
  * adding voxel to combat single point accumulation
  * filming spiderwebs
  * copying real spiders
* tracking the last edge created
* cycle tracking in graph
* parallelisation!!!
